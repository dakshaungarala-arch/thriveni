A web application (or web app) is software that runs in a web browser, accessed via the internet from a remote server, and is used to perform tasks or provide services without needing to be installed on the user's device. Web applications leverage web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to enable user interaction, data manipulation, and dynamic content delivery, contrasting with static websites. Examples include online shopping sites, email clients, and collaborative tools, offering advantages such as accessibility across devices and operating systems and eliminating the need for local installation.
